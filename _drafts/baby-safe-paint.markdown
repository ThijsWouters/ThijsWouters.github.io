title: "Baby Safe Paint"
---
I need some way to paint a wooden toy for my daughter. It is not a question of
will she put it in her mouth, but more of how frequent.

The European Union has set a standard for toy safety. It is standard [EN 71][].
More specifically standard EN 71-3 is for paints that would be safe for 
painting toys.

I found a company near me that produces paints that adhere to that standard,
it is called [Caparol][].

[EN 71]: http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/european-standards/harmonised-standards/toys/index_en.htm
[Caparol]: http://www.caparol.be
