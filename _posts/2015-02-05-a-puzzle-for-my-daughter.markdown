My daughter's first birthday is coming up. So I decided I would make her
a present. 

Recently she started playing with a wooden puzzle we got her. It looked easy
enough to make my own version of it. On to [Instructables][] to find me some
guidance.

[There][name_puzzle] I find a nice wooden puzzle with her name, but it is
laser cut. Luckily there is a [FabLab][] near where I work, where you can do
laser-cutting and other stuff.

I did make some changes to the original:

- changed the name (of course),
- used plywood instead of mdf,
- I just cut out the letters without spacing.

With the plywood the puzzle has a much nicer look. But if you are painting it,
it does not matter.

I will be adding a spacing around the letters, if I make this again. The fit is
only just enough. It is too difficult for my daughter to place the letters.

I have not applied any finishing to the puzzle as I am still looking for a 
finish that is baby proof.
