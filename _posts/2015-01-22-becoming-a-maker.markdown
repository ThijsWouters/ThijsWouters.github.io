Already early on I wanted to make stuff. I was always interested in how things
work. So I became a software developer. I am making web applications.

But recently I became more interested in making other things. But I did not
know where to start, how to begin. 

For Christmas I got [Zero to Maker][], which is a great book about starting to
make. In it David Lang talks about how he became a maker.

On this blog I will document my journey to become a maker. Stay tuned for my
first project.
