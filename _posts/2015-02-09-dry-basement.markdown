The dehumidifier worked. Our basement is dry once again.

But there was something wrong with my bucket notifier that I set up. I think
this picture explains it all:

When the bucket was almost full, the circuit was opening and closing a few
times per minute. I received about 300 emails, then mailgun limited my
account.

I will not bother to fix this as the dehumidifier is gone now.
